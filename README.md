# Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build the service functions that will fetch pokemons as stated in the requirements.

Then, we need to write all the unit tests to make sure those functions work properly (if we send X, they will return Y).

Don't forget to use Typescript.

## Requirements

You should build the API

- Fetch all Pokemons
- Fetch several Pokemons, and not necessarily starting from index 0
- Fetch 1 Pokemon by name
- Fetch 1 Pokemon by id
