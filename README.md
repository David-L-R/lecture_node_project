# Challenge

The challenge is to write unit tests to all functions in the service (`src/services/pokemonService.ts`).

The tests should cover the success path, but also the errors that might occur (you'll see possible errors in the service file).

If the architecture of this server does not make much sense, I recommend watching this video:

## Setup

1. clone the repository

2. `git switch challenge` (to switch to the branch challenge)

3. `git pull origin origin challenge`

4. `yarn` or `npm install`

5. `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the server

6. `yarn test` or `npm run test` to run the tests

## Testing

1. Go to `__tests__` folder.

2. Go to `pokemonService.test.ts` (I already created it for you ðŸ˜ƒ)

3. Write your tests! NOTICE: I did not mention all the test cases, because I want you to do it.

- The tests should cover all functionality in the `src/services/pokemonService.ts` file!
